Welcome to Hex, the hexagon connection game.
Help us make the game better!

If you want to write an AI:
I'll write a wiki up soon, but for now you can look in src/com/sam/hex/ai for examples.

If you'd rather write your own board game based off ours, email me at xlythe@gmail.com and I'll try to help with any questions.
